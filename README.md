# Virtual Machine Challenge

Back when the Synacor Challenge was up I started trying it out. This is what I got. I did not finish the challenge but I did get about 50% [a guess] of the codes before the site when down. 

I still return to the project from time to time. I even got a new code after the Website was shutdown but I am just going to assume it was correct. I do not have the codes I have receved anyware as there are copies of completed projects out there.
